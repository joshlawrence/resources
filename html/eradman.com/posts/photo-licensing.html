      <h1>On Licensing Photographs</h1>
      <p>
        When you design and create or build something your are its originator and
        therefore you are the copyright holder. For most physical objects this is not
        a deep concept because you cannot clone them. In software this is a huge
        concept because copying is not only possible but trivial.  Licensing confers
        some of the properties of ownership to others, and allows you to distribute
        material digitally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before digitizing came along it was not possible to make a clone of a
        photograph because only one person (usually the copyright holder) had the
        positive or negative from which prints could be made. You could transfer
        ownership by handing them to someone else. If you use film to take photos this
        is still the case, but there is a new kind of artifact that can be licensed:
        the digital scan itself.
      </p>

        Photos are interesting for another reason: they are not information, they are
        reflections of subjects that you did not create. Licenses that deal with
        written documents (such as Creative Commons) don't account for this in any
        way. In order to give these rights back I use the following language to share
        the ownership of digital scans
