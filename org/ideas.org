Some ideas for projects, things to learn, etc.

* technical
- learn emacs
- write some python to select random notes from a given pool of notes

some people from the ~#emacs~ room:
- macrobat

* writing
- focus on writing more frequently. start dumping ideas into the blog
- keep a running list of ideas here

* musical
- consolidate 2pianos set list into html (using org mode with html export?)
- PLAY WITH THE MOOG
- register the grandmother
- return the digitakt, trade for something else?
