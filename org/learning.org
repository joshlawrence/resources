#+DESCRIPTION: An introduction to org mode
#+TEXT: Some other text that I should include

this is an intro to org mode, and a chance to use as many different org
functions as possible to learn how everything works.

I'm currently using sensible-defaults for emacs.  themes are a nightmare, and
I'm not terribly interested in trying to use them.

* getting started

* keep going

* something else

* code blocks
  This is some information that needs to go under the code blocks heading listed
  above right there.  oh hey!  it auto-indents!

* formatting
  here *are* /some/ _different_ ~kinds~ +of+ formatting
  now for some lists:
  - this is one item
  - this is two item
  - this is three item, all done with M-RET
  - does word wrapping work on menu items?  this needs to be a really really
    really really long sentance.  it does!

this is something else.

* ah, finally!
