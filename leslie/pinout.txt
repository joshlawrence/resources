26-1 5-pin harness:

1 - black signal common
2 - grey AC
3 - green console speaker
4 - blue AC
5 - red console amp

- remove green wire from 1st terminal on the speaker amp in the a100 (terminal 1 is now empty)
- connect wire you just removed to 3 (green console speaker)
- connect 5 (red console amp) to terminal 1
- connect 1 (black signal common) to terminal 2 of amp

this works like a charm.
