PIN 3: GREY - AC common (terminals 3 and 4) / CONNECT TO LESLIE SWITCH FAT TERMINAL
PIN 4: BLUE - AC switched (terminal 7)
PIN 2: YELLOW - JUMPER TO GREY (PIN 3)
PIN 5: BROWN - CONNECT TO LESLIE SWITCH SMALL TERMINAL

Check the wiring between the switch and the Leslie 6-pin connector.  Pins 2 and 5 go straight the relay coil.  Pins 3 and 4 supply the AC to the Leslie amp.  Pins 2 and 3 should be jumpered together and pins 4 and 5 connect to the switch and complete the circuit to send the AC supply to the relay coil via pins 2 and 5.  When the switch is in it's closed position, it is in the chorale position and sends voltage to the relay.  When you switch to tremolo, the switch opens and the realy returns to it's normal off state which is the fast motors to operate.
