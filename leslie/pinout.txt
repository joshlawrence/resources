26-1 Hookup Notes
-----------------

# OPTION 1 (DEFAULT)

26-1 5-pin harness:

1 - black signal common
2 - grey AC
3 - green console speaker
4 - blue AC
5 - red console amp

- remove green wire from 1st terminal on the speaker amp in the a100 (terminal 1 is now empty)
- connect wire you just removed to 3 (green console speaker)
- connect 5 (red console amp) to terminal 1
- connect 1 (black signal common) to terminal 2 of amp

load resistor is set to middle option.

this works like a charm.

# OPTION 2

another option is to take audio signal from the AO-28 preamp.

IMPORTANT NOTE: leslie load resistor MUST be open to do this

- same as above
- same as above
- DID YOU SET THE LOAD RESISTOR TO OPEN?
- connect 5 (red console amp) to RD *OR* BK G terminal on preamp
- connect 1 (black signal common) to BN GND on preamp

results: bass response is reduced and seems smoother.
