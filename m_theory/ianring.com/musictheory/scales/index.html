			<h1>A Study of Scales</h1>
			<p class="lead">Where we discuss every possible combination of notes</p>
		</div>

		<p>This exploration of scales is based on work by William Zeitler<sup><a href="index.html#citation1">1</a></sup>. In fact much of the material on this page repeats Zeitler's findings, presented here along with additional observations and/or PHP code used to generate the scales. This exploration also owes a debt to Andrew Duncan's work on combinatorial music theory<sup><a href="index.html#citation2">2</a></sup>. Most of the code in this treatise is the result of continuous exploration and development of <a href="https://github.com/ianring/PHPMusicTools">PHPMusicTools</a>, an open-source project at GitHub. The section related to scale-chord relationships is indebted to Enrico Dell'Aquila, and his video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrOhhela3LA">Mode Colours</a></p>

		<section id="assumptions">
			<h2>Assumptions</h2>

			<p>This exploration of scales is based in a musical universe founded on two assumptions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Octave Equivalence</b>
						<br/>We assume that for the purpose of defining a scale, a pitch is functionally equivalent to another pitch separated by an octave. So it follows that if you're playing a scale in one octave, if you continue the pattern into the next octave you will play pitches with the same name.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>12 tone equal temperament</b>
						<br/>We're using the 12 tones of an equally-tempered tuning system, as you'd find on a piano. Equal temperament asserts that the perceptual (or functional) relationship between two pitches is the same as the relationship between two other pitches with the same chromatic interval distance. Other tuning systems have the notion of scales, but they're not being considered in this study.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>


				<section id="representing">
			<h2>Representing a scale</h2>

			<p>When I began piano lessons as a child, I learned that a scale was made up of whole- and half-steps. The scale was essentially a stack of intervals piled up, that happened to add up to an octave. While this view of the scale is useful for understanding diatonic melodies, it's not a convenient paradigm for analysis. Instead, we should regard a scale as being a set of 12 possibilities, and each one is either on or off.</p>

<p>The major scale, in lights.</p>

			<p>What we have in the 12-tone system is a binary "word" made of 12 bits. We can assign one bit to each degree of the chromatic scale, and use the power of binary arithmetic and logic to do some pretty awesome analysis with them. When represented as bits it reads from right to left - the lowest bit is the root, and each bit going from right to left ascends by one semitone.</p>
			<p>The total number of possible combinations of on and off bits is called the "power set". The number of sets in a power set of size <em>n</em> is (2^n). Using a word of 12 bits, the power set (2^12) is equal to 4096. The fun thing about binary power sets is that we can produce every possible combination, by merely invoking the integers from 0 (no tones) to 4095 (all 12 tones).</p>
			<p>This means that every possible combination of tones in the 12-tone set can be represented by a number between 0 and 4095. We don't need to remember the fancy names like "phrygian", we can just call it scale number 1451. Convenient!</p>

<code>$allscales = range(0, 4095);
</code>

			<table class="table">
				<tr><th>decimal</th><th>binary</th><th></th></tr>
				<tr>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>000000000000</td>
					<td>no notes in the scale</td>

				<tr>
					<td>4095</td>

					<td>chromatic scale</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p class="technical">An important concept here is that any set of tones can be represented by a number. This number is not "ordinal" - it's not merely describing the position of the set in an indexed scheme; it's also not "cardinal" because it's not describing an amount of something. This is a <b>nominal</b> number because the number *is* the scale. You can do binary arithmetic with it, and you are adding and subtracting scales with no need to convert the scale into some other representation.</p>

			<p>Because scales are cyclical - they repeat and continue beyond a single octave - it is intuitive to represent them in "bracelet" notation. This visual representation is useful because it helps conceptualize modes and rotation (which we'll get into further below).</p>
			<p>Here is the major scale, represented as a bracelet. Black beads are on bits, white beads are off bits.</p>
			<div><div class="bracelet"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="53" width="53"><circle r="19" cx="25" cy="25" stroke-width="1" fill="white" stroke="black"/><circle r="4" cx="25" cy="6" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="34" cy="8" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="41" cy="15" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="44" cy="25" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="41" cy="34" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="34" cy="41" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="25" cy="44" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="15" cy="41" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="8" cy="34" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="6" cy="25" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="8" cy="15" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="15" cy="8" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/></svg><br/><a href="https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/2741">2741</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-play2 player" data-midi="[[60],[62],[64],[65],[67],[69],[71]]"></i></div></div>
			<p>If you imagine the bracelet with clock numbers, the topmost bead - at 12 o'clock - is the root, or 1st degree of the scale. Beware that in some of the math, this is the "0" position, as if we're counting semitones above the root. To play a scale ascending, start from the top and move around it clockwise. To play the scale descending, start at 12 o'clock and go around counterclockwise.</p>

			<h3>Interval Pattern</h3>
			<p>Another popular way of representing a scale is by its interval pattern. When I was learning the major scale, I was taught to say aloud: "tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone". Many music theorists like to represent a scale this way because it's accurate and easy to understand: "TTSTTTS". Having a scale's interval pattern has merit as an intermediary step can make some kinds of analysis simpler. Expressed numerically - which is more convenient for computation - the major scale is <tt>[2,2,1,2,2,2,1]</tt>.</p>

			<h3>Pitch Class Sets</h3>
			<p>Yet another way to represent a scale is as a "pitch class set", where the tones are assigned numbers 0 to 11 (sometimes using "T" and "E" for 10 and 11), and the set enumerates the ones present in the scale. A pitch class set for the major scale is notated like this: <tt>{0,2,4,5,7,9,11}</tt>. The "scales" we'll study here are a subset of Pitch Classes (ie those that have a root, and obey Zeitler's Rules<sup><a href="index.html#citation3">3</a></sup>) and we can use many of the same mathematical tricks to manipulate them.</p>


		</section>
		<section id="whatis">
			<h2>What is a scale?</h2>
			<p>Or more importantly, what is *not* a scale?</p>

			<p>Now that we have the superset of all possible sets of tones, we can whittle it down to exclude ones that we don't consider to be a legitimate "scale". We can do this with just two rules.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>A scale starts on the root tone.</h4>
					<p>This means any set of notes that doesn't have that first bit turned on is not eligible to be called a scale. This cuts our power set in exactly half, leaving 2048 sets.</p>
					<p>In binary, it's easy to see that the first bit is on or off. In decimal, you can easily tell this by whether the number is odd or even. All even numbers have the first bit off; therefore all scales are represented by an odd number.</p>
					<p>We could have cut some corners in our discussion of scales by omitting the root tone (always assumed to be on) to work with 11 bits instead of 12, but there are compelling reasons for keeping the 12-bit number for our scales, such as simplifying the analysis of symmetry, simplifying the calculation of modes, and performing analysis of sonorities that do not include the root, where an even number is appropriate.</p>

<code>function hasRootTone($scale) {
	// returns true if the first bit is not a zero
	return (1 &amp; $scale) != 0;
}
$allscales = array_filter($allscales, 'hasRootTone');
</code>

					<p>scales remaining: 2048</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>A scale does not have any leaps greater than <em>n</em> semitones.</h4>
					<p>For the purposes of this exercise we are saying n = 4, a.k.a. a major third. Any collection of tones that has an interval greater than a major third is not considered a "scale". This configuration is consistent with Zeitler's constant used to generate his comprehensive list of scales.</p>

<code>function doesNotHaveFourConsecutiveOffBits($scale) {
	$c = 0;
	for ($i=0; $i<12; $i++) {
		if (!($scale & (1 << ($i)))) {
			$c++;
			if ($c >= 4) {
				return false;
			}
		} else {
			$c = 0;
		}
	}
	return true;
}
$allscales = array_filter($allscales, 'doesNotHaveFourConsecutiveOffBits');
</code>

					<p>scales remaining: 1490</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Now that we've whittled our set of tones to only the ones we'd call a "scale", let's count how many there are with each number of tones.</p>

<code>function countOnBits($scale) {
	$c = 0;
	for ($i=0; $i&lt;12; $i++) {
		if ($scale &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; ($i))) {
			$c++;
		}
	}
	return $c;
}

				<section id="heptatonics">
			<h2>Heptatonics</h2>
			<p>The equal temperament system of 12 tones has a special affinity for heptatonic scales. Of the 1490 scales, 413 of them are heptatonic, comprising 28% of the total. The predominant scales used in popular music are heptatonic, including those derived most closely from the circle of fifths. </p>
			<p>Some heptatonics are <em>diatonic</em>. To be diatonic means that it includes only notes in the prevailing key; so the set of diatonic scales are very limited to just the major scale and its 6 modes - and only when used in a context where the modes are offset in respect to the tonic key.</p>

			<h2>Symmetry</h2>

			<p>There are two kinds of symmetry of interest to scale analysis. They are <i>rotational symmetry</i> and <i>reflective symmetry</i>.</p>

						<section id="rotational">
				<h3>Rotational Symmetry</h3>
				<p>Rotational symmetry is the symmetry that occurs by transposing a scale up or down by an interval, and observing whether the transposition and the original have an identical pattern of steps.</p>
				<p>The set of 12 tones has 5 axes of symmetry. The twelve can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.</p>
				<p>Any scale containing this kind of symmetry can reproduce its own tones by transposition, and is also called a "mode of limited transposition" (Messaien)</p>

<code>function symmetries($scale) {
	$rotateme = $scale;
	$symmetries = array();
	for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 12; $i++) {
		$rotateme = rotate_bitmask($rotateme);
		if ($rotateme == $scale) {
			$symmetries[] = $i;
		}

					<h3>A curious numeric pattern</h3>
					<p>You'll notice that in the list of scales exhibiting rotational symmetry, many have a decimal representation that ends with the digit 5. A closer look shows that the pattern exists for all scales that have symmetry on axes of 6, 4, and 2 - where all the notes in the scale are in pairs a tritone apart. In the binary schema, each pair of notes that are a tritone apart add up to a multiple of 10, except for the root pair that adds up to 65. Therefore, all scales with rotational symmetry on the tritone will end with the digit 5.</p>

					<h3>Messiaen's Modes - and their truncations</h3>
					<p>The French composer Messiaen studied scales with rotational symmetry, because they are useful in creating sonorities with an ambiguous tonic. He famously named seven such modes, and asserted that they are the only ones that may exist; all other symmetrical scales are <em>truncations</em> of those. We can prove that Messiaen was correct, by putting every symmetrical scale into a chart of their truncation relationships.</p>
					<p>In all of Messiaen's modes, the modes are regarded as identical, which makes sense because the whole point was to create ambiguous tonality. Therefore when we speak of one of the Messiaenic modes, we're talking about a whole modal family of scales, like this one which he labeled Mode 7:</p>

					<p>Truncation is the process of removing notes from a scale, without affecting its symmetry. The concept is best explained by example.

					<p>That scale is symmetrical along the axis of a 3-semitone interval, i.e. by transposing it up a minor third. When we remove tones to create a truncation, we must preserve that symmetry, by removing four notes from the scale, like this: <div class="bracelet-group"><div class="bracelet"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="53" width="53"><circle r="19" cx="25" cy="25" stroke-width="1" fill="white" stroke="black"/><circle r="4" cx="25" cy="6" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="34" cy="8" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="41" cy="15" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="44" cy="25" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="41" cy="34" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="34" cy="41" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="25" cy="44" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="15" cy="41" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="8" cy="34" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="6" cy="25" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="black"/><circle r="4" cx="8" cy="15" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/><circle r="4" cx="15" cy="8" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"/></svg><br/><a href="https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/585">585</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-play2 player" data-midi="[[60],[63],[66],[69]]"></i></div></div></p>

					<h3>Hierarchy of truncations</h3>
					<p>This diagram illustrates that all symmetrical scales are truncations of the Messaienic modes (labeled "M" plus their number as assigned by Messaien). M1, M2, M3, and M7 are all truncations of the chromatic scale <a href="https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/4095">4095</a>; M2, M4, and M6 are truncations of M7; M1 and M5 are truncaions of M6. M1 is also a truncation of M3, and M5 is also a truncation of M4. All the other rotationally symmetrical scales are labeled "T#" and are shown where they belong in the hierarchy of truncations.</p>

				<h3>Reflective Symmetry</h3>
				<p>A scale can be said to have reflective symmetry if it has the same interval pattern whether ascending or descending. A reflectively symmetrical scale, symmetrical on the axis of the root tone, is called a <em>palindromic</em> scale.</p>

<code>function isPalindromic($scale) {
	for ($i=1; $i&lt;=5; $i++) {
		if ( (bool)($scale &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; $i)) !== (bool)($scale &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (12 - $i))) ) {
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true;
}
</code>


				<p>Here are all the scales that are palindromic:</p>

				<h3>Chirality</h3>
				<p>An object is <em>chiral</em> if it is distinguishable from its mirror image, and can't be transformed into its mirror image by rotation. Chirality is an important concept in knot theory, and also has applications in molecular chemistry.</p>
				<p>The concept of chirality is apparent when you consider "handedness" of a shape, such as a glove. A pair of gloves has a left hand and a right hand, and you can't transform a left glove into a right one by flipping it over or rotating it. The glove, therefore, is a chiral object. Conversely, a sock can be worn by the right or left foot; the mirror image of a sock would still be the same sock. Therefore a sock is not a chiral object.</p>

				<p>Palindromic scales are achiral. But not all non-palindromic scales are chiral. For example, consider the scales <span class="scale-chicklet"><a href="https://ianring.com/scales/1105">1105</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-play2 player" data-midi="[[60],[64],[66],[70]]"></i></span> and <span class="scale-chicklet"><a href="https://ianring.com/scales/325">325</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-play2 player" data-midi="[[60],[62],[66],[68]]"></i></span> (below). One is the mirror image (reflection) of the other. They are not palindromic scales. They are also achiral, because one can transform into the other by rotation.</p>

				<p>The major scale is achiral. If you reflect the major scale, you get the phrygian scale; these two scales are modes (rotations) of each other. Therefore neither of them are chiral. Similarly, none of the other ecclesiastical major modes are chiral.</p>

				<p>What makes chirality interesting? For one thing chirality indicates that a scale does not have any symmetry along any axis. If you examine all <em>achiral</em> scales, they will all have <em>some</em> axis of reflective symmetry - it's just not necessarily the root tone (which would make it <em>palindromic</em>).</p>

<code>function isChiral($scale) {
	$reflected = reflect_bitmask($scale);
	for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 12; $i++) {
		$reflected = rotate_bitmask($reflected, 1, 1);
		if ($reflected == $scale) {
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true;
}
</code>

				<p>A chiral object and its mirror image are called <em>enantiomorphs</em>. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality">source</a>)


<code>function enantiomorph($scale) {
	$scale = reflect_bitmask($scale);
	$scale = rotate_bitmask($scale, -1, 1);
	return $scale;

			<h2>Interval Spectrum / Richness / Interval Vector</h2>
			<p>Howard Hanson, in the book "Harmonic Materials"<sup><a href="index.html#citation4">4</a></sup>, posits that the character of a sonority is defined by the intervals that are within it. This definition is also called an "Interval Vector"<sup><a href="index.html#citation5">5</a></sup> or "Interval Class Vector" in Pitch Class Set theory. Furthermore, in his system an interval is equivalent to its inverse, i.e. the sonority of a perfect 5th is the same as the perfect 4th. Hanson categorizes all intervals as being one of six classes, and gives each a letter: 
			<em>p m n s d t</em>, ordered from most consonant (<em>p</em>) to most dissonant (<em>t</em>). When an interval appears more than once in a sonority, it is superscripted with a number, like <em>p<sup>2</sup></em>.

				</div>

			<p>For example, in Hanson's analysis, a C major triad has the sonority <em>pmn</em>, because it contains one perfect 5th between the C and G (<em>p</em>), a major third between C and E (<em>m</em>), and a minor third between the E and G (<em>n</em>). Interesting to note that a minor triad of A-C-E is also a <em>pmn</em> sonority, just with the arrangement of the minor and major intervals swapped. The diminished seventh chord 
				<span class="scale-chicklet"><a href="https://ianring.com/scales/585">585</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-play2 player" data-midi="[[60],[63],[66],[69]]"></i></span>				has the sonority <em>n<sup>4</sup>t<sup>2</sup></em> because it contains four different minor thirds, and two tritones.
			</p>

			<p>We can count the appearances of an interval using a method called "<a href="http://andrewduncan.net/cmt/">cyclic autocorrelation</a>". To find out how many of interval X appear in a scale, we rotate a copy of the scale by X degrees, and then count the number of positions where an "on" bit appears in both the original and copy.</p>

<code>function find_spectrum($scale) {
	$spectrum = array();
	$rotateme = $scale;
	for ($i=0; $i&lt;6; $i++) {
		$rotateme = rotate_bitmask($rotateme, $direction = 1, $amount = 1);
		$spectrum[$i] = countOnBits($scale &amp; $rotateme);
	}
	// special rule: if there is a tritone in the sonority, it will show up twice, so we divide by 2
	$spectrum[5] = $spectrum[5] / 2;
	return $spectrum;
}
</code>

			<p>All members of the same <em>modal family</em> will have the same interval spectrum, because the spectrum doesn't care about rotation, and modes are merely rotations of each other. And there will be many examples of different families that have the same interval spectrum - for example, <span class="scale-chicklet"><a href="https://ianring.com/scales/281">281</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-play2 player" data-midi="[[60],[63],[64],[68]]"></i></span> and <span class="scale-chicklet"><a href="https://ianring.com/scales/275">275</a>&nbsp;<i class="icon-play2 player" data-midi="[[60],[61],[64],[68]]"></i></span> both have the spectrum "pm<sup>3</sup>nd", but they are not modes of each other.</p>

			<p>Below is a table of some of the named scales, and their interval spectrum. You'll notice that modal families will all have the same spectrum; hence every named mode of the diatonic scale (lydian, dorian, phrygian etc.) has the same spectrum of <em>p<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>n<sup>4</sup>s<sup>5</sup>d<sup>2</sup>t</em></p>

			<h2>Evenness</h2>

<p>Another interesting property of a scale is whether the notes are evenly spaced, or clumped together. The theory of musical scale evenness owes to "Diatonic Set Theory", the work of Richard Krantz and Jack Douhett<sup><a href="index.html#citation6">6</a></sup>. In their paper, they explain how you can determine the "evenness" of a scale, first by establishing the intervals between each note and every other.</p>

<p>
	<div style="float:right;border:1px solid #666;padding:15px;margin:20px;display:block;">
		<div><img src="interval.png" style="width:200px;" /></div>
		<caption style="display:block;">Generic interval is 2, Specific interval is 5</caption>
	</div>

	A crucial concept to understand in Diatonic Set Theory is the distinction between a <em>generic interval</em> and a <em>specific interval</em>. A specific interval is the number of semitones between two tones; for example between a C and a E, that's a specific interval of 4 semitones. The generic interval is the number of <em>scale steps</em> between two tones of a scale; for example in C major scale, the distance between C and E is 2.</p>

	<p>To measure the evenness of the scale, the first step is to build the <em>distribution spectra</em>. The spectra shows the distinct specific intervals between notes, for each generic interval of the scale. Each spectrum is notated like this:</p>

	<pre>&lt;generic interval&gt; = { specific interval, specific interval, ...}</pre>

	<p>The number in angle brackets is the <em>generic interval</em>, ie we are asking "for notes that are this many steps away in the scale". The numbers in curly brackets are the <em>specific intervals</em> we find present for those steps, ie "between those steps we find notes that are this many semitones apart".</p>

	<p>It's best explained with an example. Below is the scale bracelet diagram and distribution spectra for Scale 1449:</p>

	<p>In line 1, the first spectrum, <b>&lt;1&gt;</b> indicates that we are looking at notes that are one scale step away from each other. We have notes that are one semitone apart (eg G and G#), two semitones (D# and F), and three semitones (C and D#). Duplicates of these are ignored; we merely want to know what intervals are present, not how many of them exist.</p>
	<p>In line 2, the second spectrum, <b>&lt;2&gt;</b> indicates that we are looking at notes that are two scale steps away from each other. We see pairs that are three semitones apart (eg F and G#), four semitones (D# and G), and five semitones (C and F).</p>
	<p>When there is more than one specific interval, the <b>spectrum width</b> is the difference between the largest and smallest value. For example for the <b>&lt;3&gt;</b> spectrum above, the specific intervals are <tt>{5,7}</tt> and so its width is 2, which is 7 minus 5.</p>
	<p>The <b>spectrum variation</b> is the average of all those widths.</p>

	<p>Once the distribution specta are built, we analyze them to discover interesting properties of the scale. For instance,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If all the spectra have just one specific interval, then the scale has <b>exactly equal</b> distribution</li>
		<li>If the spectra have two intervals with a difference no greater than one, then the scale is <em>maximally even</em> - it's distributed as evenly as it can be with no room for improvement.</li>
		<li>If the spectra has any widths greater than 1, then it's not maximally even.</li>
		<li>If there are exactly two specific intervals in all the spectra, then the scale is said to have <b>Myhill's property</b>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Ultimately, the measure of a scale's evenness is its Spectra Variation. We add up all the spectrum widths, and divide by the number of tones in the scale, to achieve an average width with respect to the scale size. If a scale has perfectly spaced notes with completely uniform evenness, then it has a spectra variation of zero. A higher variation means the scale distribution is less even.</p>
	<p>The following four scales have a perfect score - a spectra variation of zero:</p>

	<p>Obviously, it is possible to evenly distribute 6 tones around a 12-tone scale. But it is impossible to do that with a 5 tone (pentatonic) or 7 tone (heptatonic) scale. For such tone counts all we can hope to achieve is an <em>optimally even</em> distribution. </p>
	<p>Below are all the <em>prime</em> scales (ie with rotations omitted), sorted from most even to least even. If you click to each scale detail page, you can read its spectra variation there.</p>

			<h2>Propriety / Coherence</h2>
			<p>A scale is said to have "<em>Rothenberg propriety</em>", a quality named after David Rothenberg<sup><a href="index.html#citation7">7</a></sup>, if the scale has unambiguous relationship between generic intervals (scale degrees) and specific intervals. The same concept was discovered by Gerald Balzano, who named it <em>coherence</em>.</p>
			<p>To be <em>proper</em> (aka <em>coherent</em>), every two-step generic interval must be specifically larger than every one-step generic interval, every three-step generic interval must be specifically larger than every two-step, and so on. This means that when hearing any interval from within a scale, you can unambiguously know what generic distance it is within the scale.</p>
			<p>You can see the coherence of a scale by inspecting its distribution spectra. Look at this scale:</p>

	<p>You can see that if you hear an interval of 2 semitones, that is unambiguously a one-step generic distance. We know this because the specific distance of 2 appears in the spectra only in the 1-step spectrum.</p>
	<p>Contrarily, if we know that our scale is 1449 rooted on C, and we hear an interval of 5 semitones (a perfect fourth), this could be a generic distance of a two steps (between C and F), or it might be a generic distance of three steps (between D# and G#). That ambiguity means this scale is not coherent.</p>

	<p>There are exactly 31 coherent scales. Here they are:</p>

				<section id="hemitonia">
			<h2>Hemitonia and Tritonia</h2>
			<p>One interesting approach to understanding scales is to look at the distribution of consonant and dissonant intervals in the scale. We did this already in the "spectrum analysis" above, but two intervals in particular are commonly regarded in more depth: tritones and semitones - which are deemed the most dissonant of intervals, and those that give a scale its spice and flavour.</p>
			<p>A scale that contains semitones is called "hemitonic", and we will also refer to a hemitonic as the scale member that has the upper semitone neighbour (for example, mi-fa and ti-do in a major scale, the hemitones are mi and fa).</p>
			<p>A scale that contains tritones is called "tritonic", and we will also refer to a tritonic as the scale member that has a tritone above it. This concept seems very close to the notion of "imperfection" (explained below)</p>
			<p>Since hemitonia and tritonia are based on the interval spectrum, all the modes of a scale will have the same hemitonia. For example, the major scale is dihemitonic and ancohemitonic; thus so are dorian, phrygian, lydian, etc.</p>

								<table class="table">
					<tr><th>Number of tones</th><th># of Hemitonic Scales</th><th># of Tritonic Scales</th></tr>
					<tr><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>140</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>335</td><td>335</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>413</td><td>413</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>322</td><td>322</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>165</td><td>165</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>55</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>				</table>

			<p>It's well to know that so many scales are hemitonic and tritonic (having more than zero semitones or tritones), but obviously some scales are <em>more hemitonic</em> than others. A scale could have no hemitonics ("ahemitonic"), one ("unihemitonic"), two ("dihemitonic"), three ("trihemitonic") and so on. Let's look at the count of hemitones in our scales.

				<h3>Cohemitonia</h3>
				<p>Cohemitonia is the presense of two semitones consecutively in scale order. For instance, if a scale has three cromatically consecutive notes, then it is cohemitonic. We will also refer to the cehemitonic as the tone that has two semitone neighbours above it.</p>

				<section id="modes">
			<h2>Modes</h2>
			<p>There is a lot of confusion about what is a "mode", chiefly because the word is used slightly differently in various contexts.

			<p>When we say "C major", the word "major" refers to a specific pattern of whole- and half-steps. The "C" tells us to begin that pattern on the root tone of "C". </p>

			<p>Modes are created when you use the same patterns of whole- and half-steps, but you begin on a different step. For instance, the "D Dorian" mode uses all the same notes as C major (the white keys on a piano), but it begins with D. Compared with the Major (also known as "Ionian" mode), the Dorian sounds different, because relative to the root note D, it has a minor third and a minor seventh.</p>

			<p>The best way to understand modes is to think of a toy piano where the black keys are just painted on - all you have are the white keys: C D E F G A B. Can you play a song that sounds like it's in a minor key? You can't play a song in C minor, because that would require three flats. So instead you play the song with <em>A as the root</em> (A B C D E F G). That scale is a <em>mode of the major scale</em>, called the Aeolian Mode.</p>

			<p>When you play that minor scale, you're not playing "C minor", you're playing the relative minor of C, which is "A minor". Modes are relatives of each other if they have the same pattern of steps, starting on different steps.</p>

			<p>To compute a mode of the current scale, we "rotate" all the notes down one semitone. Then if the rotated notes have an on bit in the root, then it is a mode of the original scale. It's as if you take the bracelet diagram that we've been using throughout this study, and twist it like a dial so that a different note is at the top, in the root position.</p>

						<section id="primeform">
				<h3>Prime Form</h3>
				<p>Often when discussing the properties of a scale, those properties (like interval distribution or evenness) are the same for all related scales, ie a scale and all its the modes. In order to simplify things, it is useful to declare that one of the siblings is the "prime form" of each modal family, so when doing analysis we discard all the rotations except one.</p>
				<p>In discussing Prime Form of a scale, we are undeniably treading into the topic of <em>Pitch Class Sets</em>, a more generalized study involving every possible combination of tones, <b>regardless of the rules that make it a scale</b>.</p>

				<h4>Forte vs Rahn</h4>
				<p>There are two dominant strategies for declaring the Prime Form of a set of tones; one was defined by Allen Forte<sup><a href="index.html#citation8">8</a></sup>, and another similar one (with only subtle differences) described later by John Rahn<sup><a href="index.html#citation9">9</a></sup>. While I have deep admiration for Forte's theoretical work, I prefer the Rahn prime formula, for the simple reason that the Rahn primes are the easier to calculate.</p>
				<p>The calculation of the Prime Form according to Forte requires some inelegant cyclomatic complexity. Contrarily, computing the Rahn Prime Form is remarkably simple: <b>The Rahn Prime Form is the one with the lowest value when expressed in bits, as we have done in this study.</b> This connection between Rahn's prime forms and the bit representation of a scale was proven by me (Ian Ring) in 2017, by brute force calculation of every possible scale and prime form according to both algorithms.</p>
				<p>In a necessarily succinct overview of this topic, I'll demonstrate the differences between Forte's algoroth and Rahn's. The prime form for pitch class sets is identical except for 6 sets. Both algorithms look at the distance between the first and last tones of the set, preferring the one with the smaller interval. In the case of a tie, this is where Forte and Rahn differ: Forte begins at the start of the set working toward the end, whereas Rahn starts at the end working toward the beginning.</p>

				<p>Here are the six sets where Forte and Rahn disagree on which one is prime.</p>

			<h2>Proximity</h2>
			<p>We would consider two scales to be "near" each other, if they bear many similarities; sharing many of the same notes, such that it would take few <em>mutations</em> to turn one into the other.</p>

			<p class="technical">This distance measured by mutation is almost the same thing as a "Levenshtein Distance". The normal definition of a Levenshtein Distance on a string of characters allows three kinds of mutation: insertion, deletion, and substitution. Our scale mutations are different from a string mutation, in that scales can't do substitution, instead we move tones up or down with rules for handling collision. This difference means we can't employ all the elegant formulas bequeathed to us by Vladimir Levenshtein.</p>

			<p>We can mutate a scale in three ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Move a tone up or down by a semitone</li>
				<li>Remove a tone</li>
				<li>Add a tone</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is simple to generate all the scales at a distance of 1, just by performing all possible mutations to every interval above the root.</p>

<code>function findNearby($scale) {
	$near = array();
	for ($i=1; $i&lt;12; $i++) {							
		if ($scale &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; ($i))) {
			$copy = $scale;
			$off = $copy ^ 1 &lt;&lt; ($i);
			$near[] = $off;
			$copy = $off | 1 &lt;&lt; ($i - 1);
			$near[] = $copy;
			if ($i != 11) {
				$copy = $off | 1 &lt;&lt; ($i + 1);
				$near[] = $copy;
			}
		} else {
			$copy = $scale;
			$copy = $copy | 1 &lt;&lt; ($i);
			$near[] = $copy;
		}
	}
	return $near;
}
</code>

			<p>Evidently since every scale will have a collection of neighbours similar to this one, a complete graph of scale proximity is large, but not unfathomably so.</p>
			<p>We can also easily calculate the Levenshtein distance between two scales. Apply an XOR operation to expose changed bits between two scales. Adjacent on bits in the XOR where the bits were different in the original scale identify a "move" operation. Any bits remaining are either an addition or deletion.</p>

			<h2>Imperfection</h2>
			<p>Imperfection is a concept invented (so far as I can tell) by William Zeitler, to describe the presence or absense of perfect fifths in the scale tones. Any tone in the scale that does not have the perfect fifth above it represented in the scale is an "imperfect" tone. The number of imperfections is a metric that plausibly correlates with the perception of dissonance in a sonority.</p>
			<p>The only scale that has no imperfections is the 12-tone chromatic scale.</p>

			
			<p>This table differs from Zeitler's<sup><a href="index.html#citation10">10</a></sup>, because this script does not de-duplicate modes. If an imperfection exists in a scale, it will also exist in all the sibling modes of that scale. Hence the single imperfect tone in the 11-tone scale is found 11 times (in 11 scales that are all modally related), whereas Zeitler only counts it as one.</p>

					<li>Looking at the table, there are 5 scales of 5 tones with one imperfection. There are 6 scales of 6 tones with only one imperfection. The same patten continues right up to 11 tones. What causes this pattern?</li>
					<li>The only 7-note scale with only one imperfection is the major diatonic scale (plus all its modes). Is it a coincidence that we find this scale sonically pleasing?</li>

<h2>Negative</h2>
<p>One peculiar way we can manipulate a scale is to "flip its bits" -- so that every bit that is on becomes off, and all that were of are turned on. If you flip a scale with a root tone, you will get a non-scale without a root tone; so it's not so useful to speak of negating a scale, instead we negate an entire modal family to find the modal family that is its negative.</p>
<p>For example, one that's easy to conceptualize is the major scale, which (in C) occupies all the white keys on a piano. The negative of the major scale is all the notes that aren't in the major scale - just the black keys, which interestingly have the pattern of a major pentatonic (with F# as the root). In pitch class set theory, the negative of a set is called its "complement", and Dr Forte named complementary pairs with matching numbers.</p>

		<h2>Chord Relationships</h2>
		<p>In the case of heptatonic chords, we can use the stacked-third members of a scale to create a chord. More on this later.</p>
