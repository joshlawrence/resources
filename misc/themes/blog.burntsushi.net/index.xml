      <description>My name is Andrew Gallant and I&#39;m a programmer. I work as a systems engineer for Diffeo in Cambridge, MA where I get to work on a variety of things from machine learning algorithms to core infrastructure and user facing applications. The vast majority of my free time is spent hacking on side projects.
You may find me in other mediums under the handle burntsushi or burntsushi5.
Personal stuff I enjoy most mainstream American sports; particularly football.</description>

      <description>This page describes most of my recent projects and a selection of my favorite projects from years past. All of these are side projects, which means they were developed in my spare time.
Rust projects Lately, I&#39;ve become quite enamored with Rust. I very much enjoy the particular trade offs made in the language and like the direction that language is headed towards.
Regular expressions A port of RE2 to Rust.</description>
