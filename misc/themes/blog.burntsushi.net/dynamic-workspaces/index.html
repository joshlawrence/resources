      <p>Do you have dynamic workspaces in your window manager?</p>
<p>You might be wondering: what in the world are dynamic workspaces?
A dynamic workspace model allows one to add, remove or rename workspaces on the
fly.
Comparatively, in a typical window manager (or desktop environment)
configuration, you tell the window manager to have <strong>x</strong> number of workspaces.
When you start your window manager, you'll have <strong>x</strong> workspaces, and you can
typically cycle between them using some variation of &ldquo;next workspace&rdquo; or
&ldquo;previous workspace&rdquo; commands.
The disadvantage with this model is that it's difficult to have a large number
of workspaces&mdash;else you might forget which window is on each workspace.</p>
<p>Another approach (if you have a particularly nice window manager) is to specify
the <em>names</em> of each workspace available to you.
This lets you segregate windows into nice groups.
Perhaps one workspace is named &ldquo;web&rdquo; and is dedicated to web browsing.
Perhaps another one is named &ldquo;editing&rdquo; and is full of vim windows.
And so on.
Named workspaces are useful because they are easier to manage in large
number&mdash;all one needs is to glance at the name of a workspace and you'll know
what kind of windows are there.</p>
<p>Dynamic workspaces extend upon the named workspace approach.
While named workspaces don't change in size or name, dynamic workspaces can.
Named workspaces encourage general groups like &ldquo;web&rdquo; or &ldquo;editing&rdquo;,
dynamic workspaces encourage <em>task-oriented</em> groups.</p>
<p>For example, while developing this blog application, I created several
workspaces to manage windows related to development.
Namely, <code>blog</code>, <code>view</code> and <code>geils</code>.
<code>blog</code> contained terminals running vim for editing the source code, <code>view</code>
contained a browser window I used to view my changes and <code>geils</code> contained a
terminal logged into my web server (named
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Geils_Band">Geils</a>).
After I was done working on my blog, I simply deleted those three workspaces.
(I could also leave them there to come back to later&mdash;which is something I
often do with persistent projects like my <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/wingo">window
manager</a>.)</p>
<p>I really enjoy this approach to workspace management because it's so specific
to the tasks you're working on.
A static approach is too restraining for me; sometimes windows don't fit nicely
in each category you've created or sometimes you can't forsee how a certain
window will be used.
Additionally, sometimes you want to have more than one workspace dedicated to
some general task like &ldquo;web&rdquo;.
But how many should you make up front?
Too few and you're restrained; but too many and you have unused workspaces
cluttering up your environment.</p>
<h3 id="okay-you-convinced-me-how-can-i-get-dynamic-workspaces">Okay, you convinced me. How can I get dynamic workspaces?</h3>
<p>Typically, your window manager has to support it.
<a href="http://xmonad.org">Xmonad</a> comes to mind, as it has a
<a href="http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Actions-DynamicWorkspaces.html">DynamicWorkspaces</a>
module in
<a href="http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/index.html">xmonad-contrib</a>.
I'd also be willing to bet that <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">Awesome</a> could
also do it, given its flexible Lua configuration (but I have never used Awesome
extensively).</p>
<p>If you're using <a href="http://openbox.org">Openbox</a> (or possibly any EWMH compliant
window manager), I've developed
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/pager-multihead">a pager</a> that provides dynamic
workspaces.
(If you're using Archlinux, it's in the
<a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=51536">AUR</a>.)</p>
<p>The pager is configured in Python, and by default, <code>Super+Return</code> is bound to a
prompt that will show all available workspaces.
If you type in a workspace name that exists, you'll switch to that workspace.
If you type in a workspace name that <em>doesn't</em> exist, the pager will create
that workspace and switch you to it.
Finally, <code>Super+BackSpace</code> will delete a workspace (only when it doesn't have
any windows).</p>
<p>(If there's demand, I may write another post that describes my pager in more
detail. It actually has quite a few more nice features other than dynamic
workspaces.)</p>
