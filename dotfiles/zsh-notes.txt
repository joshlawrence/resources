* .zshenv: Sourced on all invocations of the shell. It often contains exported variables that should be available to other programs. For example, $PATH.

* .zshrc: Sourced in interactive shells only. It should contain commands to set up aliases, functions, options, key bindings, etc.

Your $PATH and any other important ENV variable should be set in .zshenv. The rest can go into .zshrc.
