Two different setups to consider:

	- home recording
	- live performance
	
Equipment:
	
	- yamaha motif
	- nord c2
	- moog grandmother
	- elektron digitakt

                            # -- HOME SETUP -- #

I need the motif on the bottom to cover piano duties.  (note: since I'm
running in mono, I need to stick to rhodes and clav.)

the organ will be on top.  the major question is the leslie sim: it won't
sound good in mono, so running with the sim off is an option (a la Brian
Auger).  everything into a mixer.

synth leads - probably not.

                               # -- PLAN -- #               

CLEANUP! STORE ALL LEADS AND CABLES.

1. REMOVE M-AUDIO FROM TOP SHELF. (WHERE TO STORE?)
2. MOVE TOP SHELF FORWARD AND TILT.
3. MOVE ORGAN ON TOP SHELF, ADJUST. REMOVE HALFMOON.
4. PLACE MOTIF.
5. SETUP SOUNDS IN MASTER BANK - RHODES, CLAV, ETC. (MONO PIANO?)

	- MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA TO BUY A SPEAKER POLE.
