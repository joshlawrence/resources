Title: What's So Funny?

I love jokes.  I love to tell jokes.  I also love stand-up comedians.  There's an art to comedy, and like any art form, it takes practice to get it right.  I've spent the past year studying various comics, and wanted to summarize what I've learned so far.

## Jokes

There are many different genres of jokes:  Stupid jokes, anti-jokes, offensive jokes, one-liners, old/corny jokes, and so on.

Most jokes follow a basic formula:  The premise/setup, and the punchline <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.

Jokes usually depend on the listener's frame of reference; telling medical jokes for a room full of steel mill workers probably isn't going to go over well.  For example, I *love* this joke by Norm Macdonald:

If you're not familiar with what musician Bob Seger looks like, however, it just isn't funny.  

## Stand-Up

Simply standing in front of a crowd rattling off jokes, however, does not make someone a comedian.  Most stand-up routines do contain jokes, but the topics flow naturally from one to the other <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>.  Stand-up routines have a form like classical music does: Themes, transitions, phrasing, etc.  Nerdwriter1 has [a wonderful video on this topic](https://youtu.be/EbthMC6spAE), using Norm Macdonald's material as an example.

_There are exceptions to this, comedians who can build an entire set from simple jokes.  [Rodney Dangerfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield) and [Stephen Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Wright) are good examples, the former being the master of the simple setup/punchline, the latter being famous for one-liners._

Good comedians always have an arsenal of comebacks for a heckler; a quick search of YouTube yields [lots of good examples](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=comedian+heckler+owned).  People seem to love watching comedians take down hecklers, however there is a *huge* difference between shutting down a rude audience member and lashing out at an audience in anger.  [Michael Richards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Richards#2006_Laugh_Factory_incident) learned this the hard way <sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>.

## Offensive Jokes and Comedians

Offensive jokes are often misunderstood.  Often a comedian is playing a character - that of a misogynist or racist or religious zealot - to highlight a problem in society.  Sometimes humor is [the only way to cope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy) with a very painful subject or event.

## Closing

I'll close this post with my favorite joke, The Moth Joke, as told by Norm Macdonald on the Conan O'Brian Show.  The basic joke goes like this:

> A moth goes into a doctor's office.  The doctor asks, "Why are you here?"  And the moth says, "The light was on."

What Norm does with it is nothing short amazing.  Enjoy!

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: So is there a perfect joke?  According to Norm Macdonald, the perfect joke is [where the setup and the punchline are exactly the same](https://youtu.be/-lcHN83vYWw).

<a name="myfootnote2">2</a>: I didn't do a very good job of explaining this, but hopefully the meaning is clear anyway...a good stand-up routine covers multiple topics, much like a novel would, and the jokes are interweaved with the exposition.

<a name="myfootnote3">3</a>: There's a really good discussion to be had here about the use of the N-word in comedy, but there's no way I'm stepping on that landmine.  Check out some clips of Louis CK and Patrice O'Neil on YouTube, and judge for yourself which side of the issue you're on.
