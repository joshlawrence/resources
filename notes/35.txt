# -- WHAT YOU FIGURE OUT AT 35 -- #

I think its because through experience people have figured out a lot of unspoken
things about what its really like being an employee.

They have figured out that its much more about connections and office politics
than hard work.

They have figured out that there is really no job security, and they could be
one layoff wave away from unemployment.

They have figured out that its much more about face time and spending long hours
at work rather than actually being productive.

They have figured out that the majority of their work, to their surprise is not
actually that important or necessary.

They have figured out that its important not to take too much vacations, because
its an opportunity to loose the little work they have to someone else.

They have figured out that they are never going to get payed the true value of
their work, and that is almost the definition of being an employee.

They have figured out that its all a system of serventry not too different from
the medieval relation between master and servant.

They have figured out that its a system that they are being grinded through and
discarded, and that they are condemned for life to making someone else rich,
never getting a chance to truly fulfill their dreams and ambitions.

All of this takes a lot of time to figure out and piece together, it takes over
ten years, and so the age 35 seems about right.
