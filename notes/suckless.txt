## -- suckless software -- ##

anything from here: http://suckless.org/rocks/

minimal software that I need to try out:

- https://www.passwordstore.org/ :: password manager
  see this howto: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pass
- http://source.netsurf-browser.org/netsurf.git/ :: web browser
- https://unix4lyfe.org/darkhttpd/ :: web server, self-contained
- http://eradman.com/entrproject/ :: run commands when files change
- https://git.codemadness.org/sfeed/file/README.html :: sfeed (note the maildir stuff)
- EMACS!!! (does this count as suckless? nope...)

distros:

other ideas:

might be nice to move from gitlab and just use a simple blog service like twtxt (https://github.com/buckket/twtxt) and point to those posts from my github page.
