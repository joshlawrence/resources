                                   REALITY

Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.
	Philip K Dick

- Objective truth:
	the physical world as it is.  There are no "chairs" in this world
	(would an ant recognize a chair, or a bacteria?) - only data from
	whcih we can derive patterns.
- Consensus truth:
	what people have agreed to be true, often via perception or abstract
	logic.  This is math, that is red, this is a chair, that is
	democracy.
- Subjective truth:
	what I believe to be true, by my own rationality or my own
	perception.  This can sometimes deviate from consensus truth (eg.
	optical illusion).
