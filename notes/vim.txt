# vim Notes

The following setup seems to accomplish what I want to do with vim:

- pathogen
- NERDtree
- vim-sensible

## installation

mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle && \
curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git

git clone https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git ~/.vim/bundle/nerdtree

cp ~/projects/resources/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc

that's it!
