xfce4-session-4.14.2:
On install:
To be able to shutdown or reboot your system, you'll have to add .rules
files in /usr/local/etc/polkit-1/rules.d directory. Which looks
like this (replace PUTYOURGROUPHERE by your group):

polkit.addRule(function (action, subject) {
  if ((action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart" ||
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop")
      && subject.isInGroup("PUTYOURGROUPHERE")) {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});

For those who have working suspend/resume:

polkit.addRule(function (action, subject) {
  if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.suspend"
      && subject.isInGroup("PUTYOURGROUPHERE")) {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});


This port installs a startup file for xscreensaver but it is
disabled by default. This is so because the XFCE metaport
installs xfce4-screensaver to autostart and having both enabled
causes conflicts.

If you want to change the screen saver being used and enable
xscreensaver please go to the Session and Startup settings, and in
the Aplication Autostart tab enable only the relevant screensaver:

Screensaver -> to enable xscreensaver
XFCE Screensaver -> to enable xfce4-screensaver
